\mylett{I}{N}  grief and also in profound thanksgiving we come to this House of God, to a place
of prayer, to a church where remembrance and hope are sacred duties. Here, where
Queen Elizabeth was married and crowned, we gather from across the nation, from the
Commonwealth, and from the nations of the world, to mourn our loss, to remember
her long life of selfless service, and in sure confidence to commit her to the mercy of
God our maker and redeemer.

With gratitude we remember her unswerving commitment to a high calling over so
many years as Queen and Head of the Commonwealth. With admiration we recall her
life-long sense of duty and dedication to her people. With thanksgiving we praise God
for her constant example of Christian faith and devotion. With affection we recall her
love for her family and her commitment to the causes she held dear.


Now, in silence, let us in our hearts and minds recall our many reasons for thanksgiving,
pray for all members of her family, and commend Queen Elizabeth to the care and
keeping of almighty God.\\\itshape\color{qred}
A brief silence is kept.

and the life; in whom whosoever believeth shall live, though he die; and
whosoever liveth, and believeth in him, shall not die eternally; who hast taught us, by
his holy Apostle Saint Paul, not to be sorry, as men without hope, for them that sleep
in him: We meekly beseech thee, O Father, to raise us from the death of sin unto the
life of righteousness; that, when we shall depart this life, we may rest in him, as our
hope is this our sister doth; and that, at the general Resurrection in the last day, we may
be found acceptable in thy sight; and receive that blessing, which thy well-beloved Son
shall then pronounce to all that love and fear thee, saying, Come, ye blessed children of
my Father, receive the kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world.
Grant this, we beseech thee, O merciful Father, through Jesus Christ, our mediator and
redeemer. \textbf{Amen}.

	THE FIRST LESSON

\end{center}

\mylett{N}{OW} is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.
For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead. For
as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive. But every man in his own
order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming. Then cometh
the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when
he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power. For he must reign, till he
hath put all enemies under his feet. The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. For
this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality. So
when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on
immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed
up in victory. O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? The sting of
death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks be to God, which giveth us
the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye
steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye
know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.

My soul is athirst for God, yea, even for the living God : when shall I come to
appear before the presence of God?
My tears have been my meat day and night : while they daily say unto me, Where is
now thy God?
Now when I think thereupon, I pour out my heart by myself : for I went with the
multitude, and brought them forth into the house of God;
In the voice of praise and thanksgiving : among such as keep holy-day.
Why art thou so full of heaviness, O my soul : and why art thou so disquieted within
me?
Put thy trust in God : for I will yet give him thanks for the help of his countenance.

house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare
a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again, and receive
you unto myself; that where I am, there ye may be also. And whither I go ye know, and
the way ye know. Thomas saith unto him, Lord, we know not whither thou goest; and
how can we know the way? Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life:
no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. If ye had known me, ye should have known
my Father also: and from henceforth ye know him, and have seen him. Philip saith unto
him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us. Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so

promote justice and the common good; give to all its citizens the spirit of mutual honour
and respect; and grant to us all grace to strive for the establishment of righteousness
and peace; for the honour of thy name. \textbf{Amen}.


\qred{The Most Reverend and Right Honourable Stephen Cottrell, Archbishop of York, Primate of
England and Metropolitan, says}

We give thanks to God for Queen Elizabeth’s loyalty to the faith she inherited through
her baptism and confirmation, and affirmed at her coronation; for her unswerving
devotion to the Gospel; and for her steadfast service as Supreme Governor of the
Church of England.

\mylett{L}{ORD}, we beseech thee to keep thy household the Church in continual godliness;
that through thy protection she may be free from all adversities, and devoutly
given to serve thee in all good works, to the glory of thy name; through Jesus Christ
our Lord. \textbf{Amen}.

\qred{The Precentor says}

Let us pray that we may be given grace to live as those who believe in the communion
of saints, the forgiveness of sins, and the resurrection to eternal life.

\mylett{B}{RING} us, O Lord God, at our last awakening into the house and gate of heaven, to
enter into that gate and dwell in that house, where there shall be no darkness nor
dazzling, but one equal light; no noise nor silence, but one equal music; no fears nor
hopes, but one equal possession; no ends nor beginnings, but one equal eternity; in the
habitation of thy glory and dominion, world without end. \textbf{Amen}.\\

come; thy will be done; on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day
our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive those who
trespass against us. And lead us not into temptation; but deliver us from
evil. For thine is the kingdom, the power, and the glory, for ever and ever.\\

Let us commend to the mercy of God, our maker and redeemer, the soul of Elizabeth, our late Queen.

\mylett{H}{EAVENLY} Father, King of kings, Lord and giver of life, who of thy grace in
creation didst form mankind in thine own image, and in thy great love offerest
us life eternal in Christ Jesus; claiming the promises of thy most blessed Son, we entrust
the soul of Elizabeth, our sister here departed, to thy merciful keeping, in sure and
certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life, when Christ shall be all in all; who died
and rose again to save us, and now liveth and reigneth with thee and the Holy Spirit, in
glory for ever. \textbf{Amen}.

\mylett{G}{O} forth, O Christian soul, from this world, in the name of God the Father
almighty, who created thee; in the name of Jesus Christ, Son of the living God,
who suffered for thee; in the name of the Holy Spirit, who was poured out upon thee
and anointed thee. In communion with all the blessed saints, and aided by the angels
and archangels and all the armies of the heavenly host, may thy portion this day be in
peace, and thy dwelling in the heavenly Jerusalem. \textbf{Amen}.
